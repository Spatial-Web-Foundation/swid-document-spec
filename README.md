## Abstract

SWIDs are identifiers for the [Spatial Web](https://spatialwebfoundation.org/),
with the following design goals and properties:

- All Spatial Web Entities (including Credentials) have SWIDs.
- The Spatial Web SWID Registry ensures uniqueness of the SWIDs.
- Most SWIDs will be created by a DID Issuer at behest of the Entity and not recorded in a centralized registry.
- The Spatial Web will include Entities with DIDs created without interaction with any particular authority.
